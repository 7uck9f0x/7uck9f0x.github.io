Fortunately, I am in one of the areas where it can be seen - Hamilton\nWhen I got up in the morning and opened the curtains, the clouds in the sky were so thick that someone swore they could make them come down. That feeling of loss of energy(;´༎ຶД༎ຶ). I found cloudy weather in several areas in the weather forecast. I originally planned to go to other places to see, but I was too lazy (-_-) zzZ, so I just wanted to take a gamble and see if there would be a chance for clear skies.\nThe result was wonderful. When I went out at about two o'clock in the afternoon, there were very few clouds. Even if there were any, they were very thin and could not block the sun's rays at all. (My gambling luck is really good (≧ω≦)). I originally wanted to stay in the dormitory building I just took a random photo underground. I happened to meet my roommate, so he took me to the outdoor stadium next to it. There were so many people, many of whom were not from our school. I left the camera and mobile phone to adjust the shooting angle for a long time. I held the phone up and ran back to the dormitory to get the phone holder (it turned out to be useless in the end, the stand was completely unstable and I still had to hold it with my hands).\nAt the moment of the total solar eclipse, people in the entire stadium were cheering, and it was very lively. Although it didn't have the effect of turning off the lights as I thought, it was indeed obviously dark and very cold.°. ·(((p(≧□≦)q)))·°.°, during certain seconds of the total solar eclipse, there is a small bright spot, which looks like a diamond ring when paired with the surrounding rings. It looks very nice(′ ▽`ʃ♡ƪ).![ring](/img/ring.jpg)\nI have a few friends in Toronto who can’t see a total solar eclipse in Toronto. It’s said to be a 99% solar eclipse. I thought the difference wasn’t very big, but they told me they didn’t feel it getting dark. Emmmmmm, the difference is indeed quite big. Yes, I took a few videos to share with them, and they were \"stolen\" (*￣︿￣). Since I don't know how to edit videos, I gave them this important task. It's not bad, I'm quite satisfied♪ (^∇^*).\n<video controls>\n<source src=\"/video/solarec.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n## Extra\nAfter returning to the dormitory, I originally wanted to order Japanese ramen takeout, but they were too busy today and did not take takeout orders (ノへ￣,). When I was looking for what I wanted to eat, I saw a dessert shop (maybe). I called Hi Yogurt and ordered a cup of kiwi yogurt and a macaron platter. They tasted pretty good, but the macarons were a little too sweet (￣ェ￣;).![dessert](/img/hiyogurt.jpg)\n","tags":["Life","Food"]},{"title":"个人博客搭建实录/Personal blog building record","url":"/2024/04/02/个人博客搭建实录-Personal-blog-building-record/","content":"# 个人博客搭建实录\n我查阅了许多搭建个人博客的框架，最终选择了hexo，由于不是很想花钱决定挂载到GitHub上。\n\n## 创建仓库\n首先是在GitHub上创建了一个新的仓库(Repository)，命名为“用户名.github.io”，我自己的就命名为“7uck9f0x.github.io”，然后选择开源(Public)，然后将.gitignore文件设置为Node，仓库就创建完成啦。\n\n## 准备搭建环境，安装Node.js和Git\n```\nsudo apt install nodejs\nsudo apt install npm\nsudo apt install git\n```\n\n## 连接到GitHub\n```\ngit config --global user.name “github username”\ngit config --global user.email “github email”\n```\n我自己的就是\n```\ngit config --global user.name “7uck9f0x”\ngit config --global user.email “7uck9f0x@gmail.com”\n```\n\n## 创建SSH密钥\n```\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C “github email”\n```\n我自己的就是\n```\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C “7uck9f0x@gmail.com”\n```\n然后一直回车就可以了\n生成了密钥后在保存密钥的地址找到`id_rsa.pub`，里面的是公钥，复制里面的内容，在GitHub的设置里找到`SSH和GPG密钥(SSH and GPG keys)`，选择创建新的SSH密钥，将复制的内容粘贴到`key`部分，`title`随便取一个就可以 \n在使用`Ssh-keygen -t rsa -C “github email” `的时候记得注意保存的地址，我最开始时是存在了/home路径下，后来觉得麻烦就把用户切到管理员，就一直在root目录操作，后来在关联的时候就一直读取不到密钥(つд⊂)，然后又重新生成了一个密钥才读取连接成功的\n在控制终端输入`ssh -T git@github.com` 出现 “Are you sure…”输入yes回车就好了，最后弹出“Hi, xxx! You’ve successfully… ” 就是连接成功了\n\n## 安装Hexo博客程序\n首先先创建一个文件架用来存放Hexo的程序文件，我是创建在了`/var/www/hexo`，然后进入到这个目录里，使用npm一键安装Hexo\n```\nnpm install -g hexo-cli\n```\n安装完成后初始化并安装组件\n```\nhexo init\nnpm install\n```\n完成后就可以生成页面并进行预览了\n```\nhexo g\nhexo s\n```\n然后就可以访问https://localhost:4000, 出现默认页面，本地博客就安装成功了(^▽^)\n\n## 上传部署\n然后就可以将Hexo部署到GitHub的page上了(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧\n首先需要安装hexo-deployer-git\n```\nnpm install hexo-deployer-git --save\n```\n然后将_config.yml文件中的Deployment部分修该如下\n```\ndeploy:\n\ttype: git\n\trepository: git@github.com:用户名/用户名.github.io.git\n\tbranch: main\n```\n最后运行`hexo d`就把网页上传部署到github上了，~~完结撒花(≧∇≦)/~~\n\n## 博客主题修改\nhexo的初始界面我不是很喜欢，就在hexo官网上浏览了好多主题，都很好看，我最后选择使用AirCloud感觉比较简洁还挺好看的\n在选择好想要的主题后点击可以直接跳转到GitHub，里面有很详细的换主题的教程，直接跟着做就好了，我尝试了挺多个的，基本流程都差不多直接用`git clone https://github.com/……` 就可以了。一般都是直接下载保存hexo文件的文件夹里的themes文件夹，不过有一些是直接保存在了hexo文件夹，如果是这种情况进入到这个文件夹里找到这个文件夹的themes复制到自己的themes就可以了，最后再到_config.yml将theme更改就ok了。我自己的就是在用使用`git clone https://github.com/aircloud/hexo-aircloud-blog.git --recursive` 后直接保存在了 `/var/www/hexo`文件夹里叫`hexo-air-blog` 再到这个文件夹里找到themes复制到我自己的themes里的，在更改完后记得要重新上传部署到GitHub\n正式完结撒花(^▽^)/★*☆♪\n\n------------------\n\n# Personal blog building record\nI checked out many frameworks for building a personal blog, and finally chose hexo. Since I didn’t want to spend money, I decided to mount it on GitHub.\n\n## Create repository\nFirst, create a new repository (Repository) on GitHub and name it \"username.github.io\". I named my own \"7uck9f0x.github.io\", then select Open Source (Public), and then The .gitignore file is set to Node, and the warehouse is created.\n\n## Prepare to build the environment and install Node.js and Git\n```\nsudo apt install nodejs\nsudo apt install npm\nsudo apt install git\n```\n\n## Connect to GitHub\n```\ngit config --global user.name \"github username\"\ngit config --global user.email \"github email\"\n```\nMy own is\n```\ngit config --global user.name \"7uck9f0x\"\ngit config --global user.email \"7uck9f0x@gmail.com\"\n```\n\n## Create SSH key\n```\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"github email\"\n```\nMy own is\n```\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"7uck9f0x@gmail.com\"\n```\nThen just press Enter\nAfter generating the key, find `id_rsa.pub` at the address where the key is saved. The public key is inside. Copy the contents. Find `SSH and GPG keys (SSH and GPG keys)` in GitHub settings and select Create a new SSH key, paste the copied content into the `key` section, and select any `title`\nWhen using `Ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"github email\" `, remember to pay attention to the saved address. At first, it existed in the /home path. Later, I found it troublesome and switched the user to the administrator. It has been there ever since. When operating the root directory, I could not read the key (つд⊂) during the association. Then I regenerated a key before reading and connecting successfully.\nEnter `ssh -T git@github.com` in the control terminal, and \"Are you sure...\" will appear. Just enter yes and press Enter. Finally, \"Hi, xxx! You've successfully...\" will pop up, indicating that the connection is successful.\n\n## Install Hexo blog program\nFirst create a file shelf to store Hexo program files. I created it in `/var/www/hexo`, then enter this directory and use npm to install Hexo with one click.\n```\nnpm install -g hexo-cli\n```\nAfter the installation is complete, initialize and install components\n```\nhexo init\nnpm install\n```\nOnce completed, you can generate the page and preview it.\n```\nhexo g\nhexos\n```\nThen you can visit https://localhost:4000, the default page will appear, and the local blog is successfully installed (^▽^)\n\n## Upload deployment\nThen you can deploy Hexo to the GitHub page (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧\nFirst you need to install hexo-deployer-git\n```\nnpm install hexo-deployer-git --save\n```\nThen modify the Deployment part in the _config.yml file as follows\n```\ndeploy:\n\ttype: git\n\trepository: git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git\n\tbranch: main\n```\nFinally, run `hexo d` to upload and deploy the web page to github, ~~Finished (≧∇≦)/~~\n\n## Blog theme modification\nI don’t like the initial interface of hexo very much. I browsed many themes on the hexo official website and they are all very good-looking. I finally chose to use AirCloud, which I found to be relatively simple and good-looking.\nAfter selecting the theme you want, click to jump directly to GitHub. There is a very detailed tutorial on changing the theme. Just follow it. I have tried many, and the basic process is almost the same. Just use `git clone https://github.com/…` will do. Generally, you download directly the themes folder in the folder where the hexo file is saved, but some are directly saved in the hexo folder. If this is the case, go into this folder and find the themes in this folder and copy it to your own. Just go to themes and finally go to _config.yml to change the theme and it will be ok. I use `git clone https://github.com/aircloud/hexo-aircloud-blog.git --recursive` and save it directly in the `/var/www/hexo` folder called `hexo -air-blog` Then find the themes in this folder and copy them to my own themes. After making changes, remember to re-upload and deploy to GitHub.\nOfficially finished with flowers (^▽^)/★*☆♪\n","tags":["CS","Linux"]},{"title":"FirstPost","url":"/2024/04/01/FirstPost/","content":"\n# 第一个帖子\n\n这是我的第一个帖子，2024年3月31日自己搭建了这个博客，其间遇到挺多困难的，像是key的路径不对，hexo主题不会更换等问题，不过好在最终都解决了，这些问题并没有阻挡我搭建这个博客，很开心。\n\n以后可能会在该博客里分享一些生活，学习心得或者一些想说的话吧UwU\n\n------------------\n\n# First Post\n\nThis is my first post. I built this blog on March 31, 2024. I encountered many difficulties during the process, such as the key path was wrong, the hexo theme would not change, etc., but fortunately, they were all solved in the end. Well, these problems did not stop me from setting up this blog, and I am very happy.\n\nIn the future, I may share some life, learning experience or what I want to say in this blog UwU\n"}]
